**UAV Attitude Control and Trajectory Planning System Development** 12/2022 - 10/2023

- **Key Words:** UAV Attitude Control System, Hardware and Software System Design, Heuristic Algorithm Optimization
- **Overview:** In this project, we proposed an anti-lockout ant colony system (ACS-DS) algorithm with two mechanisms for setting decoupling & safety values to solve the problem of local optimization in three-dimensional trajectory planning of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), taking into account the energy efficiency of a single UAV assisted fog computing network. We have integrated a fuzzy PID attitude control system for a quadrotor UAV, which is the first application of a UAV control system in an open paper in the field of Assisted Fog Computing as of October 23, and has been shown to significantly reduce (≥34%) the consumption of an existing model.

**Text-based Stock Price and Investor Sentiment Analysis** 07/2022 - Present

- **Key Words:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Mining (Scrapy Framework), LSTM Neural Networks, Sentiment Text Analysis
- **Overview:** This project aims to study the role of sentiment analysis in stock prediction. We used the Scrapy framework and BeautifulSoup web parser to crawl 400,000 stock comments text and their corresponding historical trading data from the East-money stock bar, and stored them in a database. We extracted the text feature vectors using jieba word splitting and TF-IDF methods, used a SVM sentiment classifier to classify the crawled text data into sentiment polarities and constructed an investor sentiment index. Finally, we trained price prediction models using LSTM neural network and ARIMA time series, the prediction result is a significant improvement over the baseline evaluation criteria.

**Convolutional Neural Network & Computerized Image Recognition Based Surroundings Prediction and Trajectory Planning in UAV-Assisted Fog Computing** 10/2023 - Present

- **Key Words:** Deep Learning, Computerized Image Recognition (CIR), Fog Computing, UAV Trajectory Planning
- **Overview:** The focus of this project is to utilize deep learning to help Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) predict changing trends in the environment during assisted fog computation in order to enhance UAV execution efficiency in various environmental contexts. First, OpenCV computer vision library is used for topographic image reading, edge detection, and segmentation. The map data combined with solar radiation is used to build hydrodynamic and meteorological models, which include temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and wind direction. Next, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to enable the UAV to predict the environment based on sensor and terrain image recognition. Additionally, model sharing and collaborative learning among multiple UAVs are achieved through fog computing network, allowing the UAVs to movement while avoiding abnormal terrain and meteorological regions. Compared to movement without considering predicted surroundings, the chance of crashing due to abnormal areas and weather is reduced by about 64%.
